# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

**Author:** Onigbajumo Oluwaseyi Olamide  

# Project Overview
This project analyses bank customer data to identify trends and patterns that predict customer churn. The goal is to help the bank improve customer retention strategies and business decisions.

# Tools Used 
- Power BI  
- DAX 
- Data cleaning and transformation (Power Query) 

# Data Description
The dataset includes:
- Customer ID
- Surname
- Geography
- Has credit card
- Is active member
- Age
- Gender
- Account balance
- Products held
- Churn status (Yes/No)
- Credit score
- Tenure

# Objectives
- Identify key factors that influence customer churn  
- Compare churned vs non-churned customers  
- Analyse churn rate by age group, account balance, and tenure  
- Visualise customer behaviour using interactive dashboards  
- Provide insights that can help reduce churn  

# Steps Taken in Power BI  
1. Imported the dataset into Power BI.  
2. Cleaned the data using Power Query by removing errors and standardising formats.  
3. Created calculated measures using DAX.  
4. Built visualisations to analyse churn trends by:
   - Age group  
   - Account balance  
   - Credit score  
   - Tenure  
   - Number of products  
5. Designed an interactive dashboard to communicate insights clearly.  

# Key Insights  
- Customers with lower tenure showed higher churn rates.
- Female Customer churn more than male. 
- Certain age groups were more likely to exit than others.  
- Credit score and account balance had a strong influence on churn behaviour.  
- Customers with fewer products were more likely to churn.  

# Conclusion  
This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyse, and visualise data using Power BI. It highlights patterns in customer behaviour and provides actionable insights that can support better customer retention strategies in the banking and financial sector.

I am actively building more data analysis projects and open to entry-level and remote/ hybrid data analyst roles.
